## Backend Take Home Challenge: 

This is a rest api for  ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnostic codes

# Running 
Ensure you have docker compose installed on your system and run  in the terminal

``` bash 
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start both the database(postgres) and the rest API. The REST api will 
be reachable on port 5000.
